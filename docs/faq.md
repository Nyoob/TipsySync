# Why "TipsySync"?
TipsySync perfectly captures what this app is all about. "Tipsy" reflects the core focus on tips, follows, subscriptions, and chat messages from multiple 18+ streaming platforms — making it fun and easy to remember.

The "Sync" part highlights the powerful technology: syncing and unifying all stream interactions into a single, seamless flow. With real-time updates and a generic unified WebSocket format, TipsySync brings together all your stream tips and events in one intuitive place.

In short, TipsySync is your all-in-one stream management tool that combines fun with functionality—helping you track, display, and interact with your audience like never before.

# But why did you even make this?
Well, judging by the platforms you see listed on here, you probably know my motivation.
I've originally started to enable a streamer to do custom animations by receiving tips on different platforms, without the need to implement each one separately.
Quickly i realized, this project could be expanded upon a lot, since i already got all the required data, why not do overlays, multichat & more?
The reason i wrote it in golang is primarily to learn. Originally, i'm a web & mobile dev, used to PHP, JS, Swift & Kotlin.
Golang seemed interesting enough to pick up & learn tho. Wails is also a pretty damn cool framework to get a somewhat lightweight web-based frontend.
Didn't wanna learn Qt or GTK for this, and Wails seems mature enough atp.
